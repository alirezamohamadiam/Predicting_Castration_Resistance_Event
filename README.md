Predictive Model for Castration Resistance Event in Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Using Machine Learning

Metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) marks a pivotal stage in prostate cancer management, where accurately anticipating the emergence of castration resistance holds paramount importance for treatment decisions. This study capitalizes on the capabilities of machine learning, specifically the random forest classifier, to construct a predictive model for predicting the occurrence of Castration Resistance Events (CREs). By leveraging a comprehensive dataset obtained from MSK (Clin Cancer Res 2020), encompassing clinical, genetic, and molecular attributes, we undertook a comprehensive analysis to uncover patterns and associations indicative of castration resistance development.

The random forest classifier was employed to capture the inherent interactions within the dataset and to create a robust predictive model. Our findings demonstrate a noteworthy accomplishment, as the developed model exhibits an impressive accuracy of 75% in foreseeing Castration Resistance Events. This achievement underscores the potential of machine learning methodologies in augmenting the accuracy of prognosticating outcomes that are pivotal in prostate cancer treatment.

The success of this research not only contributes to the advancement of our comprehension regarding metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer but also introduces a pragmatic tool that clinicians can deploy to inform therapeutic approaches and potentially optimize patient outcomes. As the realm of oncology embraces data-centric strategies, the demonstrated effectiveness of the random forest classifier in this context holds promise for broader applications across cancer research and personalized medicine.
